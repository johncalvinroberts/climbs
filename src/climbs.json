This route is mostly protected from the rain, but there are still some parts where it seeps through cracks in the rock. Other than the second bolt, it was an enjoyable climb. Pumpy! Final bolt to the top was done 100% on faith, due to pumpiness. When you fall due to \"pump\", or tirendess in the arms, that is 100% due to a mental limit, NOT physical limit. This route proved that to me. You just need to overcome your mental limit."

Second time I gave it a serious attempt, had my mental game on lock, but still was absolutely gutted on 5th bolt and had to take. Probably could have pushed through. Third attempt was a regression -- I fell on the second bolt! Luckily Chyah caught me just fine. Rested again on 4th and 5th bolt. Guh. Gonna have to come back for the redpoint on this one. BTW -- some people say this is 5.10d, some say 5.11a if you climb the outer line on the big flake (rather than going up behind the flake)."
